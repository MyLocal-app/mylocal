# Project Name - CAM.IO #

## HEADING ##
  > Crowdsourcing Your Event Promotion.

## SUB-HEADING ##
  > A event promotion power tool for organizers in driving sold-out ticket sales!

## SUMMARY ##
  > An app for event organizers to harness the network of social influencers (i.e. on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, Weibo, etc) to amplify and incentivize promotion/marketing for your next upcoming event.

## PROBLEM ##
  > As event organizers you want to promote your event without having to seem like spamming potential attendees. In addition, typical marketing/advertising is not as cost effective in terms of actually getting attendess to purchase tickets and attend your event.


## SOLUTION ##
  > This is where CAM.IO comes in. The app allows for event organizers to organically/socially promote their event by incentivizing social influencers (and also their attendees) to promote their event on their behalf with referral reward system.

  > Another side-solution/benefit to this app is that it allows event organizers to identify their most loyal and influential customers so that they can "re-hire" them for their next upcoming event.

## QUOTE FROM YOU ##
