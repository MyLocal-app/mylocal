### Indentation

When writing any block of code that is logically subordinate to the line immediately before and after it, that block should be indented two spaces more than the surrounding lines

* No tab spaces please
* Increase the indent level for all blocks by two extra spaces
    * When a line opens a block, the next line starts 2 spaces further in than the line that opened

        ```javascript
        // good:
        if(condition){
          action();
        }

        // bad:
        if(condition){
        action();
        }
        ```

    * When a line closes a block, that line starts at the same level as the line that opened the block
        ```javascript
        // good:
        if(condition){
          action();
        }

        // bad:
        if(condition){
          action();
          }
        ```

    * No two lines should ever have more or less than 2 spaces difference in their indentation, with the exception of .then() promise chains and API endpoint tests. For example:

        ```javascript
        // bad:
        transmogrify({
          a: {
            b: function(){
            }
        }});
        ```
    * An example of our exception case would be:

        ```javascript
        // exception:
        app.post('/api/route', (req, res) => {
          someMethod(args1, args2)
            .then(() => todo());
            .catch(error => todoOther());
        });
        ```

### Variable names

* A single descriptive word is best.

    ```javascript
    // good:
    var animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish'];

    // bad:
    var targetInputs = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish'];
    ```

* Collections such as arrays and maps should have plural noun variable names.

    ```javascript
    // good:
    var animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish'];

    // bad:
    var animalList = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish'];


*  braces for statement blocks.
    ```javascript
    // good:
    for(key in object){
      alert(key);
    }

    // bad:
    for(key in object)
      alert(key);
    ```

* Always use `===` and `!==`, since `==` and `!=` will automatically convert types in ways you're unlikely to expect.

    ```javascript
    // good:

    if(0 === ''){
      alert('looks like they\'re equal');
    }

    // bad:
    if(0 == ''){
      alert('looks like they\'re equal');
    }
    ```

* Don't use function statements.

    ```javascript
    // good:
    var go = function(){...};

    // bad:
    function stop(){...};
    ```


### Semicolons

* Don't forget semicolons at the end of lines

  ```javascript
  // good:
  alert('hi');

  // bad:
  alert('hi')
  ```

* Semicolons are not required at the end of statements that include a block--i.e. `if`, `for`, `while`, etc.


  ```javascript
  // good:
  if(condition){
    response();
  }

  // bad:
  if(condition){
    response();
  };
  ```

* Misleadingly, a function may be used at the end of a normal assignment statement, and would require a semicolon (even though it looks rather like the end of some statement block).

  ```javascript
  // good:
  var greet = function(){
    alert('hi');
  };

  // bad:
  var greet = function(){
    alert('hi');
  }
  ```

# Supplemental reading

### Code density

* Conserve line quantity by minimizing the number lines you write in. The more concisely your code is written, the more context can be seen in one screen.
* Conserve line length by minimizing the amount of complexity you put on each line. Long lines are difficult to read. Rather than a character count limit, I recommend limiting the amount of complexity you put on a single line. Try to make it easily read in one glance. This goal is in conflict with the line quantity goal, so you must do your best to balance them.

### Comments

* Provide comments any time you are confident it will make reading your code easier.
* A good comment is often less effective than a good variable name.


### Padding & additional whitespace

    ```javascript
    // good:
    alert( "I chose to put visual padding around this string" );

    // bad:
    alert( "I only put visual padding on one side of this string");
    ```

* You may use it to align two similar lines, but it is not recommended.

    ```javascript
    // discouraged:
    var firstItem  = getFirst ();

* Put `else` and `else if` statements on the same line as the ending curly brace for the preceding `if` block
    ```javascript
    // good:
    if(condition){
      response();
    } else {
      otherResponse();
    }

    // bad:
    if(condition){
      response();
    }
    else{
      otherResponse();
    }
    ```


    ```


### Opening or closing too many blocks at once

* The more blocks you open on a single line, the more your reader needs to remember about the context of what they are reading. Try to resolve your blocks early, and refactor.

    ```javascript
    // avoid:
    _.ajax(url, {success: function(){
      // ...
    }});

    // prefer:
    _.ajax(url, {
      success: function(){
        // ...
      }
    });
    ```


### Variable declaration

* Use a new var statement for each line you declare a variable on.
* Do not break variable declarations onto mutiple lines.
* Use a new line for each variable declaration.

    ```javascript
    // good:
    var ape;
    var bat;

    // bad:
    var cat,
        dog

    // use sparingly:
    var eel, fly;
    ```

* For lists, put commas at the end of each newline, not at the beginning of each item in a list

    ```javascript
    // good:
    var animals = [
      'ape',
      'bat',
      'cat'
    ];

    // bad:
    var animals = [
        'ape'
      , 'bat'
      , 'cat'
    ];
    ```

* Avoid use of `switch` statements, except when writing Redux reducers.
* Prefer single quotes around JavaScript strings, rather than double quotes. Having a standard of any sort is preferable to a mix-and-match approach, and single quotes allow for easy embedding of HTML, which prefers double quotes around tag attributes.

    ```javascript
    // good:
    var dog = 'dog';
    var cat = 'cat';

    // acceptable:
    var dog = "dog";
    var cat = "cat";

    // bad:
    var dog = 'dog';
    var cat = "cat";
    ```


### HTML

* Do not use ids for html elements. Use a class instead.

    ```html
    <!-- good -->
    <img class="lucy" />

    <!-- bad -->
    <img id="lucy" />
    ```
